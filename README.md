## About SisMOM / INPE / MCTI Project

SisMOM is an acronym for **Oil Spill Monitoring System for the Ocean**. It is funded by the Ministry of Science and Technology ([MCTI]()) via [FINEP]() and is executed by [INPE]() which engaged several partners institutions. In a nutshell, SisMOM, is a proof of concept of a dissuasion tool for IBAMA and Brazilian Navy and is based on nine sub-projects which is composed by a coordinator and collaborators. [More about SisMOM]().

1. Ship Detection
Responsible for detecting ships from satellite data (optical and SAR). Traditional CFAR methodology and Deep Learning is going to be used to build a labelled dataset for AI training.

2. Oil Spill Detection
Responsible for detecting oil spill in the ocean, also from satellite data (optical and SAR). This sub-project will also build a labelled training dataset with uses cases occurred in Brazil by using traditional (but good) methodologies. Dr. Milton Kampel, from INPE's Remote Sensing dept is the coordinator. In addition to monitor oil spill in the ocean, we'll mine social media in order to check (via AI) for messages and photos related to oil spill on the beach. This is important because in some cases the oil navigates under the surface of the water and suddenly appears on the beach. And we want to check it as soon as possible.
